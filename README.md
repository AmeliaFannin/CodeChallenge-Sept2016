2) a) Write a function that takes two arrays of integers and returns true if the second array is a subset of the first, or false otherwise. e.g.

is_subset([5,2,6,7], [7,2]) -> true
is_subset([5,2,6,7], [1,7]) -> false
b) Describe the performance characteristics of your solution using Big O notation.

3) We have some social network posts in a JSON-encoded file (posts.json, attached). We want to learn about the users who made these posts.

Write a program that reads the data from the file and outputs the following:

The id and user name of the user with the highest number of followers.
The id and user name of the user who posted closest to our office (GPS coordinates are latitude: 42.356680, longitude: -71.060395)
